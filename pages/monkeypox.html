    <h1>Monkeypox</h1>
    <hr />
    <br />
    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <h5>
      Since early May 2022, cases of monkeypox have been reported from countries where the disease is not endemic, and continue to be reported in several endemic countries. Most confirmed cases with
      travel history reported travel to countries in Europe and North America, rather than West or Central Africa where the monkeypox virus is endemic. This is the first time that many monkeypox cases
      and clusters have been reported concurrently in non-endemic and endemic countries in widely disparate geographical areas. WHO is collaborating with health authorities to prevent further spread
      of the disease. We are issuing guidance to help countries on surveillance, laboratory work, clinical care, infection prevention and control, as well as risk communication and community
      engagement to inform communities at risk and the broader general public about monkeypox and how to keep safe. We are also working closely with countries in Africa, regional institutions, and
      technical and financial partners, to support efforts to bolster laboratory diagnosis, disease surveillance, readiness and response actions to prevent further infections.

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <h5>
      <b>Take the following steps to prevent getting monkeypox:</b>
      <li>Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with people who have a rash that looks like monkeypox.</li>
      <li>Do not touch the rash or scabs of a person with monkeypox.</li>
      <li>Avoid contact with objects and materials that a person with monkeypox has used.</li>
      <li>Do not share eating utensils or cups with a person with monkeypox.</li>
      <li>Do not handle or touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person with monkeypox.</li>
      <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating or touching your face and after you use the bathroom.</li>
    </h5>

    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <h5>
      People with monkeypox get a rash that may be located on or near the genitals or anus and could be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth. The rash will go through several
      stages, including scabs, before healing. The rash can initially look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
      <br /><br>
      Other symptoms of monkeypox can include:
      <li>Fever</li>
      <li>Chills</li>
      <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
      <li>Exhaustion</li>
      <li>Muscle aches and backache</li>
      <li>Headache</li>
      <li>Respiratory symptoms</li>

      <br>
      Sometimes, people have flu-like symptoms before the rash. Some people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Others only experience a rash.
